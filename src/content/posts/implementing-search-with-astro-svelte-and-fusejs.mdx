In this post you will learn how to set up search functionality
for a static site without much effort at all. I had actually implemented this
functionality for this site late last year but I figure now is as good of a
time as any to explain how.

## What's the tech?
Our search functionality will be driven by Fuse.js. Fuse.js is a good choice for
us because it allows us to create a searchable index of our blog posts at build
time that can be deployed to a CDN and fetched by the client later when they
go to search. There are other libraries that allow us to do the same thing but
Fuse.js is often recommended and it's a popular choice and reasonably
well-maintained.

Since this is an Astro blog the examples will be shown in the context of
the Astro framework. I also chose to use Svelte components to implement
this functionality, mostly because I desired to learn a bit more about
Svelte, but with little web dev experience you should be able to translate
the core concepts to other component libraries and frameworks.

If you don't have any web dev experience or don't feel up to the task, 
you may follow along using Astro and Svelte or optionally clone the source code 
for this site to your machine (my github is linked in the footer).

## Serving up the Data
The first step in adding search functionality is to create the list and
search index that will be utilized by Fuse.js client-side to fuzzily match 
a user's query to the title or description of a blog post.

Since I'm using Astro, the easiest way to do this is to leverage Astro's endpoint
functionality. The name "endpoint" is a bit misleading because with
statically generated sites the "endpoint" is just a file (in this case a JSON file)
that is generated at build time and placed in the dist folder.

To create this Astro endpoint we will create a file named "post-index.json.ts" at
the root of the pages directory. Within that file we want to export an async function
with the name of GET. In this function we will use Astro's content collection API to
fetch our blog posts' metadata as well as create an index with fuse.createIndex.
In this case our endpoint looks like this:
```js
/*
  src/pages/post-index.json.ts
*/
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";
import fuse from "fuse.js";

export async function GET() {
  const posts = await getCollection("posts");
  const postMetadata = posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
    title: post.data.title,
    pubDate: post.data.pubDate,
    description: post.data.description,
  }));
  const postIndex = fuse.createIndex(["title", "description"], postMetadata);
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({
      index: postIndex.toJSON(),
      metadata: postMetadata,
    })
  );
}
```
It's important to note that you shouldn't be saving any metadata that you won't
need to get back when performing a search. For my purposes, all that I need is
the slug, title, pubDate, and description. The slug is for navigation to the blog
post when a search result is clicked on and the other properties are used when
displaying the search results to the user.

You'll notice that when creating the index the first argument I provide is an array of
"title" and "description". These are the keys I want the users of my website
to search against. I don't include the content of the blog post because I don't
want to bloat the size of the statically generated file. We want the list and
search index to be loaded as quickly as possible so that the user doesn't have to
wait much time at all to begin searching.

## Using the Data
Now we have our list and a pre-generated search-index but we still don't
have a way for users of this site to use it. For my purposes it made
sense to create a new page for this functionality. The page itself doesn't need
to be complex. For this site it just consists of an header and a Search component
like so:
```js
---
/*
  src/pages/search/index.astro
*/
import BaseLayout from "@layouts/BaseLayout.astro";
import Search from "@components/Search.svelte";
---

<BaseLayout
  title="Search"
  description="Search for blog posts."
>
  <h1>Search</h1>
  <Search client:load />
</BaseLayout>
```
Don't worry too much about the "BaseLayout" component. All that does it take the title and description props
and inserts it into the head element of the generated HTML. It also renders the Header and Footer component
so they appear consistently on every page.

The real complexity is hiding behind the "Search" component, which as you can see in the example above includes
a client directive that tells Astro to hydrate the generated HTML with JavaScript as soon it is loaded
by the client.

Instead of showing you the entire component at once I'll break it down piece by piece.

To start off we need to keep track of three things:
1. The fuse instance
2. The user's query
3. The search results

Since I'm using Svelte these are just three variables declared at the start of the file
in the script tag, like so:
```js
<script lang="ts">
  /* import statements here*/

  let fuse: Fuse<PostMetadata>;
  let searchParam: string;
  let searchResults: FuseResult<PostMetadata>[] = [];

...
</script>
```

If I was using React, I might store the fuse instance in a useRef hook, the searchParam
as state, and the searchResults would be derived state from the fuse instance and the
search param, memoized with useMemo.

The next step is to create a function that fetches our pre-generated file, uses that
file to create the fuse instance, and finally gets the initial search results. In my case that
function looks like this:
```js
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("/post-index.json");
    if(!response.ok) {
      throw new Error();
    }
    const data: PostIndexResp = await response.json();
    const postIndex: FuseIndex<PostMetadata> = Fuse.parseIndex(data.index);
    fuse = new Fuse(
      data.metadata,
      { keys: ["title", "description"] },
      postIndex
    ) as Fuse<PostMetadata>;
    /* Get search parameter from URL */
    searchParam = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("q") ?? "";
    searchResults = fuse.search(searchParam);
  };
```
I'm using URL query parameters here because I want search results to be shareable via
URL but you don't have to do it this way, of course. And yes, that seemingly unhandled
error might look a little scary out of context but it will make sense with in my next code
sample. 

Obviously now we need to use this function to fetch our data and display the results
to the user. Svelte makes this especially easy with their logic blocks, especially
their await block. With an await block we can fetch the data, show an initial loading
state while the promise is pending, and then display one result
if the promise resolves and another if it is rejected. In this case it looks like this:
```js
{#await fetchData()}
  <Spinner />
{:then}
  <label class="sr-only" for="search"> Search </label>
  <input
    id="search"
    type="search"
    placeholder="Start typing..."
    value={searchParam}
    on:input={onInput}
  />
  <span>{searchResults.length} Results</span>
  <ol aria-label="search-results">
    {#each searchResults as post}
      <li>
        <Card
          slug={post.item.slug}
          title={post.item.title}
          pubDate={post.item.pubDate}
          description={post.item.description}
        />
      </li>
    {/each}
  </ol>
{:catch}
  <span> Error loading search index. Search unavailable.</span>
{/await}
```
Hopefully the example is somewhat self-explanatory. We're waiting for fetchData
to resolve and while we do that we display a loading "Spinner" component. When
it's resolved the markup within the "\{:then}" block is displayed. Our search
bar just consists of a label and an input of type "search". The search results
are displayed in a list where each list element is a "Card" component which
takes the responsibility of displaying an overview of a blog post to a user.
Finally, if the error rejects, some text is rendered explaining to the user
that the search functionality is currently unavailable.

If you're wondering what the onInput handler looks like, it simply takes the
value from the input when it changes, puts that in the URL via URLSearchParams
and does a search on the value with the fuse instance.

## Closing Thoughts
I didn't expect search to be this easy to implement but the combination of Fuse.js,
Astro's endpoint functionality, and Svelte's await logic block made it really easy.
I don't suspect using other libraries/frameworks would make it
much more difficult either. If I was to use React I'd have to do my due diligence to 
properly keep track of loading and error states or I could outsource that responsibility
to another library like react-query which seems to be fashionable nowadays.

I could be a bit more diligent about my bundle size and use a plain Astro component so I
won't have to ship the entire Svelte framework (a whopping 2.8 MB) with my "Search" component.
That is a drawback of using component libraries/frameworks in your Astro projects, but it is
oh so tempting because of the conveniences they offer.

When considering whether to use Fuse.js you have to think about some of the performance
implications of its implementation. If your static blog site is like most with just a few
posts published to it every once in a while, it's a great solution. However, if you're
talking about many thousands of potential search results then that's when this solution
starts to break down. The time Fuse takes to search on a list increases linearly with the
size of that list. Also the bigger the list of items and the bigger the search index the
longer it takes to fetch the statically generated file from your CDN or webserver to the 
client. At that point you are forced to consider a dynamically generated site or an always
online web API that can respond to users' search queries.

With all of that considered, I hope that you find this blog post useful in implementing search 
for your own static site or you at least learned a little bit more about the topic.
